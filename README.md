Project 3: Around The U.S.

Project 3 introduces Figma and various techniques to build a webpage with responsive design while also honing the skills learned in previous lessons to create a dynamic experience.

Grid layout and media queries work in tandem with flexbox to create an ordered layout for the webpage that is uniform and displays all of the information necessary regardless of which type of screen is being used. The absence of the horizontal scroll bar gives the page an ergonomic feel.
